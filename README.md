# SUBIT‑64 ATLAS  
## Universal Semantic Architecture — System Stack v1.0

SUBIT‑64 ATLAS is a universal system of **64 semantic archetypes**, organized into an **8‑level System Stack**.  
It provides a structural model describing how any system — physical, biological, cognitive, social, or informational — **unfolds from matter to abstraction**.

The Atlas serves as a foundation for:

- semantic classification  
- reasoning engines  
- AI architectures  
- narrative systems  
- systems analysis  
- modeling complex phenomena  

SUBIT‑64 is a **universal language of meaning**, built on stable, interpretable archetypes.

# Overview

SUBIT‑64 consists of 64 archetypes, each describing a fundamental type of phenomenon:

- material states  
- organic processes  
- dynamics  
- perception  
- spectral fields  
- psychic states  
- social structures  
- abstract models  

Each archetype includes:

- a mask (core form)  
- a shadow (contrast)  
- an optimum (healthy mode)  
- a pathology (dysfunction)  
- domains of application  

This makes SUBIT‑64 suitable for both human‑centered and AI‑centered systems.

# SUBIT‑64 System Stack

SUBIT‑64 is organized into **eight levels**, each emerging from the previous one:

1. **Matter** — carriers, basic forms of existence  
2. **Organic** — growth, development, living systems  
3. **Dynamics** — movement, processes, interactions  
4. **Perception** — sensory qualities  
5. **Spectrum** — perceptual fields  
6. **Psychic** — internal states  
7. **Social** — roles, structures, communication  
8. **Abstract** — models, order, boundaries, synthesis  

This is an **architecture of meaning**, applicable across all scales.
