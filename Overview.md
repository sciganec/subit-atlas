# **SUBIT‑64 Overview**

SUBIT‑64 is a universal semantic framework built on a 64‑node topology.  
It provides a compact, interpretable structure for modeling states, processes, behaviors, and conceptual patterns across domains.

The system is designed to be:

- **minimal** — no redundant elements  
- **complete** — full coverage of semantic space  
- **topological** — every node is defined by its position  
- **interpretable** — no black‑box assumptions  
- **modular** — usable in analysis, modeling, and AI integration  

SUBIT‑64 functions as a semantic coordinate system: a way to locate meaning, classify signals, and map transitions.

## **1. Structure of the System**

SUBIT‑64 is built from three interacting layers:

### **1.1 The Stack (8 Layers)**  
A vertical hierarchy representing increasing complexity:

1. Matter  
2. Organic  
3. Dynamics  
4. Perception  
5. Spectrum  
6. Psychic  
7. Social  
8. Abstract  

Each layer contains eight nodes, forming the 8×8 grid.

### **1.2 The Axes (6 Binary Dimensions)**  
Every node is defined by a six‑bit vector.  
These axes represent fundamental semantic tensions (e.g., stability vs. change, internal vs. external).  
Together they generate the full 64‑state space.

### **1.3 The Topology (64‑Node Cube)**  
The system forms a 6‑dimensional hypercube:

- each node has up to six neighbors  
- distance is measured by bit‑flips  
- transitions follow topological adjacency  
- clusters emerge naturally from structure  

This topology ensures that meaning is not arbitrary but structurally determined.

## **2. Node Anatomy**

Each of the 64 nodes includes:

- **en_name** — canonical English label  
- **mask** — functional behavioral expression  
- **shadow** — distortion under stress  
- **optimum** — best‑case expression  
- **pathology** — destructive extreme  

This creates a compact but expressive profile for each state.

## **3. Mapping and Classification**

SUBIT‑64 supports several modes of semantic mapping:

### **3.1 Nearest‑Example Classification**  
A transparent baseline method using:

- tokenization  
- Jaccard similarity  
- example‑based inference  

Implemented in:

- `subit-mapper.py`  
- `subit-mapper.js`  
- `subit-mapper-web.js`

### **3.2 Multi‑Label Mapping**  
Inputs can map to multiple nodes when they contain mixed signals.

### **3.3 Trajectory Mapping**  
Processes can be represented as sequences of nodes (e.g., conflict → negotiation → synthesis).

### **3.4 Axis‑Aware and Topology‑Aware Scoring**  
Future versions will incorporate:

- axis weighting  
- topological distance  
- stack‑level inference

## **4. Use Cases**

SUBIT‑64 is domain‑agnostic and can be applied to:

- cognitive and emotional modeling  
- organizational analysis  
- creative workflows  
- narrative structures  
- UX and interaction patterns  
- AI behavior modeling  
- semantic search and clustering  

Its minimal structure makes it suitable for both human interpretation and machine integration.

## **5. Design Principles**

SUBIT‑64 follows a strict set of principles:

- **Minimalism** — only necessary elements  
- **Structural clarity** — topology defines meaning  
- **Interpretability** — every decision is explainable  
- **Fractality** — patterns repeat across scales  
- **Modularity** — components can be used independently  
- **Authorial control** — no hidden dependencies  

These principles ensure the system remains stable, extensible, and coherent.

## **6. Roadmap Summary**

Planned expansions include:

- axis‑vector integration  
- topology‑aware classifier  
- SUBIT Engine (semantic operations)  
- SUBIT Studio (interactive visualizer)  
- expanded mapping datasets  
- API and CLI tooling  
- formal ontology documentation  

Full roadmap is available in `ROADMAP.md`.
