# **SUBIT‑64 Layer Interactions**

This document describes how the eight layers of the SUBIT‑64 stack interact with one another.  
While each layer has its own dynamic profile (see Layer-Dynamics.md), layer interactions define:

- vertical influence  
- cross-layer modulation  
- resonance patterns  
- upward and downward flows  
- stabilizing and destabilizing effects  

This document is **informative**, not normative.

# **1. Interaction Model**

Layer interactions operate along three principles:

1. **Vertical influence** — higher layers reinterpret lower layers; lower layers constrain higher layers  
2. **Cross-layer modulation** — layers modify the expression of axis patterns in adjacent layers  
3. **Resonance** — certain layers amplify or dampen each other’s dynamics  

Layers do not change axis definitions; they change **how axes behave in context**.

# **2. Upward Influence (Bottom → Top)**

Lower layers provide:

- grounding  
- constraint  
- structure  
- determinacy  

Higher layers reinterpret these foundations.

### **2.1 Matter → Organic**
- Matter provides stability  
- Organic introduces adaptive oscillation  

### **2.2 Organic → Dynamics**
- Organic provides regulated motion  
- Dynamics amplifies it into active propagation  

### **2.3 Dynamics → Perception**
- Dynamics provides motion  
- Perception transforms it into sensory modulation  

### **2.4 Perception → Spectrum**
- Perception provides distributed signals  
- Spectrum expands them into fields  

### **2.5 Spectrum → Psychic**
- Spectrum provides gradients  
- Psychic internalizes them  

### **2.6 Psychic → Social**
- Psychic provides internal modulation  
- Social externalizes it  

### **2.7 Social → Abstract**
- Social provides distributed activity  
- Abstract synthesizes it into conceptual structures  

Upward influence increases:

- abstraction  
- distribution  
- indeterminacy  
- divergence  

---

# **3. Downward Influence (Top → Bottom)**

Higher layers provide:

- conceptual structure  
- generalization  
- distributed patterns  

Lower layers enforce:

- concreteness  
- determinacy  
- singularity  
- stability  

### **3.1 Abstract → Social**
- Abstract provides conceptual frameworks  
- Social grounds them in collective behavior  

### **3.2 Social → Psychic**
- Social provides external signals  
- Psychic internalizes them  

### **3.3 Psychic → Spectrum**
- Psychic provides internal gradients  
- Spectrum stabilizes them into fields  

### **3.4 Spectrum → Perception**
- Spectrum provides abstract tones  
- Perception translates them into sensory modulation  

### **3.5 Perception → Dynamics**
- Perception provides distributed signals  
- Dynamics converts them into motion  

### **3.6 Dynamics → Organic**
- Dynamics provides motion  
- Organic regulates it  

### **3.7 Organic → Matter**
- Organic provides adaptive structure  
- Matter grounds it in physical stability  

Downward influence increases:

- concreteness  
- determinacy  
- convergence

# **4. Adjacent Layer Interactions**

Adjacent layers have the strongest interactions.

### **4.1 Organic ↔ Dynamics**
- Organic regulates  
- Dynamics accelerates  

### **4.2 Perception ↔ Spectrum**
- Perception modulates  
- Spectrum expands  

### **4.3 Psychic ↔ Social**
- Psychic internalizes  
- Social externalizes  

These pairs form **dynamic dyads**.

# **5. Resonance Patterns**

Certain layers resonate strongly with each other.

### **5.1 Dynamics ↔ Social**
Both amplify:

- activity  
- externality  
- propagation  

### **5.2 Spectrum ↔ Abstract**
Both amplify:

- abstraction  
- distribution  
- indeterminacy  

### **5.3 Organic ↔ Psychic**
Both amplify:

- oscillation  
- modulation  
- internal variation  

Resonance increases:

- divergence  
- cascades  
- non-linear transitions

# **6. Stabilizing Interactions**

Some layers stabilize others.

### **6.1 Matter stabilizes Organic**
Prevents runaway oscillation.

### **6.2 Organic stabilizes Dynamics**
Prevents uncontrolled propagation.

### **6.3 Perception stabilizes Spectrum**
Prevents excessive abstraction.

### **6.4 Psychic stabilizes Social**
Prevents over-amplification.

### **6.5 Abstract stabilizes Spectrum**
Provides conceptual structure.

Stabilizing interactions increase:

- convergence  
- coherence  
- predictability  

---

# **7. Destabilizing Interactions**

Some layers destabilize others.

### **7.1 Dynamics destabilizes Organic**
Pushes oscillation into cascades.

### **7.2 Spectrum destabilizes Perception**
Pushes modulation into diffusion.

### **7.3 Social destabilizes Psychic**
Pushes internal modulation into overload.

### **7.4 Abstract destabilizes Social**
Pushes collective behavior into conceptual divergence.

Destabilizing interactions increase:

- divergence  
- cascades  
- non-local transitions

# **8. Cross-Layer Flow Types**

### **8.1 Convergent Flow (Top → Bottom)**
```
Abstract → Social → Psychic → Spectrum → Perception → Dynamics → Organic → Matter
```
Produces:

- grounding  
- stabilization  
- simplification  

### **8.2 Divergent Flow (Bottom → Top)**
```
Matter → Organic → Dynamics → Perception → Spectrum → Psychic → Social → Abstract
```
Produces:

- expansion  
- abstraction  
- complexity  

### **8.3 Oscillatory Flow (Middle Layers)**
```
Dynamics ↔ Perception ↔ Spectrum ↔ Psychic
```
Produces:

- loops  
- spirals  
- modulation cycles

# **10. Summary**

Layer interactions define:

- how meaning moves vertically  
- how processes stabilize or destabilize  
- how abstraction and concreteness flow  
- how internal and external dynamics exchange  
- how distributed and singular patterns propagate  

Layers are not isolated — they form a **vertical semantic ecosystem**.
