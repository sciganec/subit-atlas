# **SUBIT‑64 Axis Interactions**

This document describes how the six binary axes of SUBIT‑64 interact to produce composite semantic patterns.  
While each axis is independent and orthogonal, their **combinations** generate higher‑order structures that shape node behavior, cluster formation, and trajectory dynamics.

This document is **informative**, not normative.

---

# **1. Interaction Model**

Axes interact through **bitwise combinations**.  
Each combination produces a distinct semantic configuration.

Interaction types:

1. **Synergistic** — axes reinforce each other  
2. **Antagonistic** — axes pull in opposite directions  
3. **Orthogonal** — axes combine without interference  
4. **Modulatory** — one axis modifies the expression of another  

These interactions do not change axis definitions; they describe **emergent patterns**.

---

# **2. Synergistic Interactions**

Synergy occurs when two axes amplify a shared semantic direction.

### **2.1 Change + Active (b1 = 1, b3 = 1)**

```
x1x1xx
```

Reinforces:

- motion  
- initiative  
- transformation  

### **2.2 Abstract + Distributed (b5 = 1, b4 = 1)**

```
xxxx11
```

Reinforces:

- conceptual spread  
- field‑like behavior  

### **2.3 Indeterminate + External (b6 = 1, b2 = 1)**

```
x1xxx1
```

Reinforces:

- openness  
- environmental sensitivity  

---

# **3. Antagonistic Interactions**

Antagonism occurs when axes push in opposite semantic directions.

### **3.1 Stability + Change (b1 = 0, b1 = 1)**  
Occurs across neighbors:

```
0xxxxx ↔ 1xxxxx
```

Creates tension between:

- persistence  
- transformation  

### **3.2 Passive + Active (b3 = 0, b3 = 1)**

```
xx0xxx ↔ xx1xxx
```

Creates tension between:

- receptivity  
- initiation  

### **3.3 Determinate + Indeterminate (b6 = 0, b6 = 1)**

```
xxxxx0 ↔ xxxxx1
```

Creates tension between:

- clarity  
- openness  

These antagonisms often appear in **stress paths** and **oscillations**.

---

# **4. Orthogonal Interactions**

Orthogonality means two axes combine without modifying each other’s meaning.

Examples:

### **4.1 Internal / External + Concrete / Abstract**

```
x0xx0x  
x1xx1x
```

Orientation does not affect abstraction level.

### **4.2 Stability / Change + Singular / Distributed**

```
0xx0xx  
1xx1xx
```

Structural persistence does not constrain distribution.

Orthogonality is the basis for **clean combinatorial semantics**.

---

# **5. Modulatory Interactions**

Modulation occurs when one axis changes the *expression* of another without altering its polarity.

### **5.1 Abstract (b5 = 1) modulates Active (b3 = 1)**

```
xx1x1x
```

Active becomes:

- conceptual  
- symbolic  
- non‑physical  

### **5.2 Distributed (b4 = 1) modulates Stability (b1 = 0)**

```
0xx1xx
```

Stability becomes:

- networked  
- field‑based  
- multi‑point  

### **5.3 Indeterminate (b6 = 1) modulates Internal (b2 = 0)**

```
x0xxx1
```

Internal becomes:

- fluid  
- ambiguous  
- introspective  

Modulation is key to **semantic nuance**.

---

# **6. Three‑Axis Interaction Patterns**

Some triads form recognizable semantic families.

### **6.1 Change + Active + External**

```
x111xx
```

Represents:

- outward transformation  
- dynamic expression  

### **6.2 Stability + Internal + Passive**

```
x000xx
```

Represents:

- containment  
- introspection  
- conservation  

### **6.3 Abstract + Distributed + Indeterminate**

```
xxxx11
```

Represents:

- diffuse conceptual fields  
- open systems  

---

# **7. Four‑Axis Interaction Patterns**

Four‑axis combinations create **semantic modes**.

### **7.1 Active + Distributed + Abstract + Indeterminate**

```
xx1x11
```

Mode:

- emergent  
- fluid  
- multi‑agent  
- conceptual  

### **7.2 Stable + Singular + Concrete + Determinate**

```
0xx000
```

Mode:

- grounded  
- precise  
- sharply bounded

# **8. Axis Interaction Matrices**

### **8.1 Synergy Matrix**

| Axes | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| b1 + b3 | dynamic activation |
| b4 + b5 | distributed abstraction |
| b2 + b6 | open externality |

### **8.2 Antagonism Matrix**

| Axes | Interaction |
|------|-------------|
| b1 ↔ b1 | stability vs change |
| b3 ↔ b3 | passive vs active |
| b6 ↔ b6 | determinate vs indeterminate |

### **8.3 Modulation Matrix**

| Modulator | Modified Axis | Effect |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| b5 | b3 | conceptual action |
| b4 | b1 | distributed stability |
| b6 | b2 | fluid interiority |

---

# **9. Axis Interaction in Trajectories**

Trajectories often follow **axis‑wise gradients**.

### **9.1 Convergence**

```
011100 → 011000 → 010000
```

Axes:

- b3 flips  
- b4 flips  

### **9.2 Divergence**

```
000011 → 010111 → 110111
```

Axes:

- b1, b2, b4 flip sequentially  

### **9.3 Spiral**

```
101000 → 101100 → 001100 → 001000
```

A 4‑step loop across orthogonal axes.

---

# **10. Axis Interaction and Stress**

Stress tends to push:

- b1 → 1 (change)  
- b6 → 1 (indeterminate)  
- b3 → 1 (active)  

### **Example**

```
Base:     010010
Stress:   110011
```

Three axes flip.

---

# **11. Axis Interaction and Optimum**

Growth tends to push:

- b3 → 1 (active)  
- b4 → 1 (distributed)  
- b5 → 1 (abstract)  

### **Example**

```
Base:     001000
Optimum:  001110
```

Three axes shift toward expansion.

---

# **12. Summary**

Axis interactions produce:

- synergy  
- antagonism  
- orthogonality  
- modulation  
- composite patterns  
- semantic modes  
- trajectory gradients  

These interactions are the **combinatorial engine** of SUBIT‑64.
