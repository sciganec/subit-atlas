# **SUBIT‑64 Axis Examples**

This document provides concrete examples of how the six binary axes of SUBIT‑64 combine to form nodes, clusters, and transitions.  
It illustrates the functional role of axes without redefining their semantics.

The examples are **informative**, not normative.

---

# **1. Single‑Axis Variation**

A single‑axis flip produces a minimal semantic shift.  
Below are examples of how changing one bit modifies a node.

### **Example 1 — Axis 1 (Stability / Change)**

```
Base:     000000  → stable, internal, passive, singular, concrete, determinate
Flip b1:  100000  → change-oriented version of the same pattern
```

### **Example 2 — Axis 3 (Passive / Active)**

```
Base:     010000
Flip b3:  011000  → same orientation, but active instead of passive
```

### **Example 3 — Axis 6 (Determinate / Indeterminate)**

```
Base:     001010
Flip b6:  001011  → same structure, but more open/indeterminate
```

These illustrate **local topological neighbors**.

---

# **2. Two‑Axis Variation**

Two flips produce a stronger semantic shift.

### **Example**

```
Base:     010100
Flip b2:  000100
Flip b5:  000000
```

Interpretation:

- external → internal  
- abstract → concrete  

This is a **2‑bit move**, distance = 2.

---

# **3. Full Axis Vector Examples (Canonical Patterns)**

Below are sample axis vectors and their structural interpretations.

### **Example A — 000000**

- stable  
- internal  
- passive  
- singular  
- concrete  
- determinate  

Represents the most grounded, fixed, minimal state.

---

### **Example B — 111111**

- change  
- external  
- active  
- distributed  
- abstract  
- indeterminate  

Represents the most fluid, open, maximal state.

---

### **Example C — 101010**

- change  
- internal  
- active  
- singular  
- abstract  
- determinate  

A hybrid pattern combining dynamism with internal focus.

---

### **Example D — 010101**

- stability  
- external  
- passive  
- distributed  
- concrete  
- indeterminate  

A dispersed, receptive, externally oriented configuration.

---

# **4. Axis‑Defined Clusters**

Clusters emerge from shared axis patterns.

### **4.1 Stability Cluster (b1 = 0)**

All nodes with:

```
0xxxxx
```

These nodes share:

- structural persistence  
- lower volatility  

### **4.2 Active Cluster (b3 = 1)**

All nodes with:

```
xx1xxx
```

These nodes share:

- initiation  
- outward motion  

### **4.3 Abstract Cluster (b5 = 1)**

All nodes with:

```
xxxx1x
```

These nodes share:

- conceptual generality  
- non-material qualities  

Clusters can overlap.

---

# **5. Cross‑Axis Patterns**

Some combinations produce recognizable semantic families.

### **5.1 Internal + Passive (b2 = 0, b3 = 0)**

```
x00xxx
```

Characteristics:

- introspective  
- receptive  
- low outward motion  

### **5.2 External + Active (b2 = 1, b3 = 1)**

```
x11xxx
```

Characteristics:

- expressive  
- outward‑directed  
- high interaction  

### **5.3 Singular + Determinate (b4 = 0, b6 = 0)**

```
xxx0x0
```

Characteristics:

- focused  
- sharply bounded  
- precise  

---

# **6. Axis‑Driven Transitions**

### **6.1 Minimal Transition (1‑bit)**

```
011100 → 011101
```

Only b6 changes.

### **6.2 Orthogonal Transition (3‑bit)**

```
010011 → 101100
```

Distance = 3.

### **6.3 Full Inversion (6‑bit)**

```
001010 → 110101
```

This is the antipode.

---

# **7. Layer‑Aligned Axis Patterns**

Nodes in different layers may share axis vectors.

### **Example**

```
Layer 1 (Matter):    010010
Layer 5 (Spectrum):  010010
```

Same axis pattern, different semantic altitude.

---

# **8. Axis Patterns in Trajectories**

Trajectories often follow axis‑wise movement.

### **Example Trajectory**

```
011100 → 011000 → 010000
```

Axis changes:

- b3 flips (active → passive)  
- b4 flips (distributed → singular)  

This represents a **convergence** trajectory.

---

# **9. Axis Patterns in Semantic Families**

Semantic families often share 3–4 bits.

### **Example Family**

```
011100
011000
010000
010100
```

Shared bits:

- b1 = 0  
- b2 = 1  
- b5 = 0  

This forms a **local semantic field**.

---

# **10. Axis Patterns and Stress Paths**

Stress often pushes nodes toward:

- b6 = 1 (indeterminate)  
- b1 = 1 (change)  

### **Example**

```
Base:     010010
Stress:   110011
```

Two axes flip under pressure.

---

# **11. Axis Patterns and Optimum Paths**

Growth often pushes nodes toward:

- b3 = 1 (active)  
- b4 = 1 (distributed)  

### **Example**

```
Base:     001000
Optimum:  001110
```

Three axes shift toward expansion.
