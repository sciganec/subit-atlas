# **SUBIT‑64 Axis–Layer Matrix**

This document describes how the six binary axes of SUBIT‑64 interact with the eight semantic layers of the stack.  
Axes define **structural polarity**; layers define **semantic altitude**.  
The matrix below shows how each layer tends to *express*, *modulate*, or *bias* each axis.

This document is **informative**, not normative.

# **1. Matrix Overview**

The matrix answers the question:

> *How does each layer tend to express each axis polarity?*

Notation:

- **0** — the layer tends to express the “0‑pole” of the axis  
- **1** — the layer tends to express the “1‑pole” of the axis  
- **±** — the layer expresses both poles depending on context  
- **∅** — the axis is neutral at this layer (no bias)

This is **not** a rule — it is a **tendency**.

# **3. Layer-by-Layer Interpretation**

## **1. Matter**
- stable  
- external  
- passive  
- singular  
- concrete  
- determinate  

This is the most grounded, fixed layer.

---

## **2. Organic**
- stability with adaptive variation  
- internal ↔ external modulation  
- passive ↔ active depending on function  
- concrete but with emerging indeterminacy  

Organic systems oscillate between poles.

---

## **3. Dynamics**
- change‑oriented  
- external  
- active  
- mixed singular/distributed  
- concrete  
- partially indeterminate  

Dynamics is the first strongly “1‑leaning” layer.

---

## **4. Perception**
- stability ↔ change  
- internal ↔ external  
- passive  
- distributed  
- mixed concrete/abstract  
- indeterminate  

Perception is the first layer where **distributed + indeterminate** becomes dominant.

---

## **5. Spectrum**
- fully distributed  
- abstract  
- indeterminate  
- mixed activity  
- mixed orientation  

This is the most “field‑like” layer.

---

## **6. Psychic**
- internal  
- abstract  
- indeterminate  
- mixed activity  
- mixed distribution  

Psychic states are fluid and internally modulated.

---

## **7. Social**
- external  
- active  
- distributed  
- mixed abstraction  
- mixed determinacy  

Social systems amplify **external + active + distributed**.

---

## **8. Abstract**
- change  
- distributed  
- abstract  
- indeterminate  
- mixed orientation  
- mixed activity  

This is the most “1‑leaning” layer overall.

# **6. Applications**

The Axis–Layer Matrix is useful for:

- predicting node behavior  
- designing mapping heuristics  
- interpreting trajectories  
- constructing semantic clusters  
- understanding cross‑layer projections  

It is a **meta‑tool** for reasoning about SUBIT‑64.
