# SUBIT‑64 Archetypes  
## Summary Table of All 64 Semantic Archetypes

This document provides a **compact, structured overview** of all 64 archetypes in the SUBIT‑64 System Stack.  
It is designed as a **reference table** for quick lookup, classification, and system integration.

Each archetype is listed with:

- **Code** — S00–S63  
- **Name** — canonical archetype label  
- **Group** — System Stack level (1–8)  
- **Essence** — short functional definition  

For full descriptions (mask, behavior, shadow, optimum, pathology, applications), see `atlas-full.md`.
