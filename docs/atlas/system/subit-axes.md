# SUBIT‑64 Axes  
## The Six Foundational Dimensions of the Semantic Space

SUBIT‑64 is built on **six fundamental axes**, each representing a binary polarity that defines how meaning is structured and differentiated within the system.  
These axes form the **coordinate system** of the SUBIT semantic space — the underlying logic that allows 64 archetypes to exist as stable, interpretable units.

The axes are not categories; they are **structural tensions** that shape all phenomena.  
Every SUBIT archetype is a unique configuration across these six dimensions.

# Purpose of the Axes

The SUBIT axes provide:

- a **formal semantic coordinate system**  
- a **compact representation** of meaning (6 bits → 64 states)  
- a **structural logic** behind the System Stack  
- a way to **compare, cluster, and map** archetypes  
- a foundation for **reasoning engines and classifiers**  

They ensure that SUBIT‑64 is not a list but a **mathematically coherent semantic architecture**.

# The Six Axes

Below is a high‑level description of each axis and its polarity.

---

## **Axis 1 — Materiality ↔ Abstraction**  
**Question:** Is the phenomenon grounded in physical form or conceptual structure?

- **Materiality:** concrete, embodied, physical, sensory  
- **Abstraction:** conceptual, symbolic, structural, meta‑level  

This axis defines the **vertical gradient** of the System Stack — from Matter (Group 1) to Abstract (Group 8).

---

## **Axis 2 — Unity ↔ Multiplicity**  
**Question:** Does the phenomenon express singularity or plurality?

- **Unity:** one, whole, focused, singular  
- **Multiplicity:** many, distributed, parallel, composite  

This axis governs how systems scale and differentiate.

---

## **Axis 3 — Stability ↔ Change**  
**Question:** Is the phenomenon static or dynamic?

- **Stability:** structure, order, persistence  
- **Change:** motion, transformation, evolution  

This axis defines whether an archetype preserves or alters state.

---

## **Axis 4 — Internal ↔ External**  
**Question:** Does the phenomenon originate inside or outside the system?

- **Internal:** subjective, emotional, introspective, intrinsic  
- **External:** environmental, relational, contextual, extrinsic  

This axis is key for distinguishing psychic vs. social vs. material states.

---

## **Axis 5 — Order ↔ Chaos**  
**Question:** Does the phenomenon impose structure or disrupt it?

- **Order:** rules, clarity, organization  
- **Chaos:** turbulence, unpredictability, breakdown  

This axis governs system coherence and entropy.

---

## **Axis 6 — Passive ↔ Active**  
**Question:** Does the phenomenon receive or initiate action?

- **Passive:** receptive, observational, responsive  
- **Active:** initiating, driving, generating  

This axis defines agency and directionality.

# How the Axes Generate 64 Archetypes

Each archetype in SUBIT‑64 is a **unique combination** of the six axes:

```
6 axes → 2^6 = 64 possible configurations
```

This creates:

- a **complete semantic space**  
- no redundancy  
- no missing states  
- a stable, interpretable structure  

The axes ensure that every archetype is:

- distinct  
- structurally necessary  
- positioned within a coherent topology  

---

# Relationship to the System Stack

The axes are **orthogonal** to the 8 groups.

- The **System Stack** describes the *sequence of emergence* (Matter → Abstract).  
- The **Axes** describe the *semantic coordinates* of each archetype.

Together they form:

- a **vertical architecture** (8 levels)  
- a **horizontal semantic space** (6 axes)  

This dual structure makes SUBIT‑64 both **evolutionary** and **geometric**.

---

# Applications of the Axes

The axes enable:

### **1. Semantic Classification**
Map any concept, object, or behavior to a 6‑bit coordinate.

### **2. Reasoning Engines**
Use axis polarity to infer transitions and relationships.

### **3. Archetype Clustering**
Group states by shared structural properties.

### **4. System Modeling**
Represent complex systems as trajectories through the 64‑state space.

### **5. AI Integration**
Provide interpretable embeddings and symbolic reasoning layers.

# Summary

The six SUBIT axes form the **semantic backbone** of the entire system.  
They define how meaning is structured, differentiated, and related across the 64 archetypes.

Together with the System Stack, they create a **complete, minimal, and universal semantic architecture**.
